### 🔄 Complete Implementation Flow

#### **Phase 1: Image Capture & Preparation (Flutter)**

**User Interaction Flow:**
1. **Camera Integration**: User taps "Diagnose Plant" button
2. **Image Source Selection**: Modal presents Camera vs Gallery options
3. **Capture/Selection**: Native device camera or photo library access
4. **Real-time Preview**: Show captured image with crop/retake options
5. **Compression Pipeline**: Automatic optimization for upload efficiency

**Technical Considerations:**

- **Supported Formats**: JPEG, PNG, WebP with automatic format detection
- **Size Constraints**: Client-side compression to <5MB for optimal API performance
- **Metadata Handling**: Strip EXIF data for privacy while preserving quality

#### **Phase 2: Secure Upload & Processing (Node.js Backend)**

**Backend Gateway Responsibilities:**
1. **Request Validation**: File type, size limits, malformed data detection
2. **API Key Security**: Plant.id credentials never exposed to client
3. **Request Formatting**: Transform Flutter upload to Plant.id expected format
4. **Error Handling**: Timeout, rate limiting, API failures gracefully managed
5. **Response Mapping**: Complex Plant.id JSON simplified for mobile consumption

**Security Architecture:**
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse (100 requests/hour per IP)
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate all incoming data
- **API Key Rotation**: Environment-based key management
- **Error Masking**: Never expose internal API details to client

#### **Phase 3: AI Analysis Integration (Plant.id API)**
